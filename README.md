# Return Ready Lab 14

* Part A - Foundations 6.1
* Part B - Foundations 6.2
* Part C - Instructor Challenge

## Part A

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab14.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example01_Counting` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab14.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity01_CountUpBy10s` per the following:

        Create a program that uses a loop to count.
        The count should start at ten and end at 100.
        You should only count up by 10s - look at the example below

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):
```
10
20
30
40
50
60
70
80
90
100
```

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab14.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example02_LoopPrint` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab14.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity02_FixThisLoop` per the following:

    Modify the existing loop so that it prints "Hello" five times

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

### Example and Activity 03

#### Step 01

In the package `lab12.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example03_Challenge` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab12.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity03_ArrayLoop` per the following:

    Create a program that has an array of Strings with six unique elements
    Use a loop of your preference to print out each unique element of the array

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
Kaleb
Tariq
Gio
Sam
Steph
Michael
```

## Part B

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab14.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example01_DoWhileLoopDemo` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab14.part_b.activity` complete the `Activity01_DoWhileLoop` per the following:

    Create a program that has an array of integers with five unique values
    Utilize a do/while loop to print out each of the unique elements of the array

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
43
55
68
91
105
```

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab14.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example02_WhileLoopDemo` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab11.part_b.activity` complete the `Activity02_WhileLoop` per the following:

    Create a program that loops through numbers - beginning at 1 and up to 1,000
    As the program loops through each number, it should print out all of the even values
    Be sure to use a while loop to perform the loop and printing
    HINT: Remember to use a certain operator to perform the logical check for whether or not the number is even

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
2 is even
4 is even
6 is even
8 is even
10 is even
...
...
...
992 is even
994 is even
996 is even
998 is even
1000 is even
```
